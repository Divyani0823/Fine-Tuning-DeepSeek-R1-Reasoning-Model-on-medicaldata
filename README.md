# Fine-Tuning DeepSeek-R1 Reasoning Model

## Overview

This project focuses on fine-tuning the **DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B** model for medical reasoning tasks. The primary objective is to enhance the modelâ€™s ability to generate **logical, step-by-step explanations** before providing final responses. By leveraging **Unsloth's optimized framework**, the fine-tuning process is made efficient while ensuring high-quality outputs.
